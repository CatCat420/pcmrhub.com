Our goal is to create a website that will automate our donations, control our
giveaways and help donators and advertisers make transactions.

First let's make a minimal website. Here's what we need:
1: a friendly introduction that explains what PCMRHub is and our history. This will be on the index page.
2: a page that contains a well formatted copy of our facebook group rules.
3: a page that show people where to donate to us including our paypal and our gofundme.
4: a page that explains our advertising system. How much each plan costs, and who to contact for a custom advertising plan.
This is all for now. Our main goal will require much more than this but let's take it one step at a time.
